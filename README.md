## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this app that maintains the state of the customer's cart of products in a global store(context) and provide it to the necessary components that requires the data.

The users should be able to:

- Add products to the cart
- View the cart updating every time they add a new item or remove it.

**Reflection on my learnings üöÄ
 - Learnt the working of Context API and how state is managed throughout the components in the app
 - Understood why and how data flows through a component
 - Learnt how to provide the context to its child components
 - Implemented prop drilling for laying out product data in the form of cards
 - Refined knowledge of using useState hook
 - Used CSS grid for cards layout
 
 **More fine-tuning needed to the project/ Future modifications ‚è±Ô∏è
  - Make it responsive for mobile screens
  - Add more functionality
